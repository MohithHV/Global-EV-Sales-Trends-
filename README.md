# Global-EV-Sales-Trends-
Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Electric Vehicle Sales (2011–2022): Trends, Regional Variations, and Powertrain Insights                               zz  
“This project analyzes historical EV sales data from the IEA Global EV Data Explorer (2011–2022) to identify trends, market penetration, and regional variations. Using Python-based EDA (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we observe strong global growth in EV sales, particularly in recent years, with notable regional disparities. BEVs dominate over PHEVs. These insights can guide policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers in fostering sustainable transportation.”
